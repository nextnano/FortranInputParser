Input parser Manual

The given input parser reads and analyzes an input file according to predefined syntactical rules.
It is written in Fortran 2003.

The main idea is to realize a tool, which enables the user to write position independent (as far as possible) input files.
The input files can be changed without recompiling the parser.
The parser checks the input file for syntactical correctness, for the presence of required input and for correctness of the data types of the given variable values.

Additionally, functions and variables are supported.

The input parser can be read in several times during a program run, i.e. it is possible to read in an input file which was modified and generated by the program running it.


Input parser: Keywords - General introduction to some of the keywords and specifiers including some examples
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Specification of input file name*

The specification of the input filename is done as a first entry in file keywords.val as follows:

!---------------------------------------------------!
$input_filename                        optional     !
 input-filename         character      optional     !
$end_input_filename                    optional     !
!---------------------------------------------------!

Example

!---------------------------------------------------!
$input_filename                        optional     !
 my_input_file.in       character      optional     ! Reads in "my_input_file.in".
$end_input_filename                    optional     !
!---------------------------------------------------!
